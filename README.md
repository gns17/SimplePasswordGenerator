# (SPG) Simple Password Generator
A really simple code which, after a series of inputs, creates a randomnly generated password.
It'll ask the user for any amount of letters, followed by symbols, then numbers.

Once each amount has been decided by the user, it'll take all the characters and shuffle them, providing a print at the end for a simple password.
